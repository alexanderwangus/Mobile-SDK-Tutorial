## About this Repository
---
Within this repository you will find all of DJI's tutorials on using the DJI Mobile SDK. Each tutorial covers how to utilize the tools available in the SDK to create an application to be used with a DJI drone:
- [First Person View (FPV)](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Tutorial/blob/master/en/Android/FPVDemo/Part1/FPVDemo_Part1_en.md): Our introductory tutorial, which guides you through connecting to your drone's camera to display a live video feed in your app, through which you can take photos and videos.
- [Photo and Video Album](): A follow up to the FPV tutorial, this tutorial teaches you how to construct an application to view media files onboard a DJI drone's SD card.
- [Groundstation](): Teaches you how to construct a Groundstation app, which allows you to plot a flight route for your drone by placing waypoints on a map.
